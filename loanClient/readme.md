## 1. Introduction

The Cosmos App Chain Web Server is a Go application designed to serve as an interface between clients and a Cosmos application chain. It allows clients to make HTTP requests to interact with the app chain and retrieve relevant information.

## 2. Features

- **HTTP Server**: Provides an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests.
- **Request Handling**: Handles various types of requests to the Cosmos app chain.
- **Security**: Implements security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Customization**: Easily configurable to work with different Cosmos app chains and configurations.

## 3. Getting Started
