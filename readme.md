## 1. Introduction

The Cosmos DeFi Lending Chain is a blockchain-based platform built using the Cosmos SDK and scaffolded with Ignite. It allows users to participate in decentralized lending and borrowing activities. This chain leverages the security and interoperability features of the Cosmos ecosystem to create a secure and efficient DeFi lending solution.

## 2. Features

- **Decentralized Lending**: Users can lend their assets and earn interest while maintaining control of their funds.
- **Borrowing**: Borrowers can obtain loans by collateralizing their assets and paying interest on the borrowed amount.
- **Lending Markets**: The platform supports multiple lending markets, each with its own parameters and assets.
- **Governance**: Users can participate in governance proposals to influence the platform's parameters and upgrades.
- **Security**: Utilizes the security features of the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus to ensure a secure environment.

## 1. Introduction

The Cosmos App Chain Web Server is a Go application designed to serve as an interface between clients and a Cosmos application chain. It allows clients to make HTTP requests to interact with the app chain and retrieve relevant information.

## 2. Features

- **HTTP Server**: Provides an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests.
- **Request Handling**: Handles various types of requests to the Cosmos app chain.
- **Security**: Implements security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Customization**: Easily configurable to work with different Cosmos app chains and configurations.

## 3. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) (Version 1.16+)
- [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) (Installed and configured)
- [Your Cosmos App Chain Node](https://github.com/your-cosmos-app-chain) (Running and accessible)

### Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd cosmos-app-chain-web-server
```

Install the necessary Go dependencies:

```bash

go mod tidy

```

## 4. Configuration

Customize the web server's configuration by modifying the config.yaml file. Configure settings such as the Cosmos app chain's endpoint and other server parameters.
## 5. Usage
Running the Web Server

To run the Cosmos App Chain Web Server, use the following command:

```bash

go run main.go

```

This will start the web server, and it will be accessible at the specified address and port in the configuration.
### Handling Requests

The web server is designed to handle various HTTP requests. Clients can make GET, POST, and other HTTP requests to interact with the Cosmos app chain. Refer to the documentation for available endpoints and request formats.
